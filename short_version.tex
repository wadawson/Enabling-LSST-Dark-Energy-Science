%{\bf General guidelines for April 18th: we should produce brief "white papers" describing the science in greater detail and
%		quantifying the capabilities needed. Similar to a rough draft of an NOAO observing proposal.
%		It has the same elements of compelling science, technical description and quantitative
%		statement of resource needs. But does not have to be very polished.}

{\bf{\it Executive Summary:}}

{\it One paragraph summarizing (1) the main science goals, (2) needed capabilities (top level detailed specifications such as resolution, wavelength coverage, FOV, multiplex), (3) estimate of demand to meet science goals (e.g., number of nights, fiber hours), and (4) priorities for each capability (3-tier: critical, very important, important). The chapter should be $\sim$10 pages. }

\section{Introduction}

A key driver for LSST is to investigate the nature of the source of the accelerating expansion of the Universe.  The primary possibilities are that there is a new, unknown component which dominates the energy density in the Universe today (commonly labeled ``dark energy''), or else that Einstein's theory of General Relativity (GR) fails to provide an accurate description of the action of gravity on large scales (a class of models generally referred to as ``modified gravity'' theories).  Many of the planned cosmological measurements from LSST can also be used constrain neutrino masses and dark matter properties.  {\bf By strengthening LSST cosmological constraints and mitigating potential systematics, the work described in this chapter will help LSST to address a key objective identified in the {\it New Worlds, New Horizons} report, studying the Physics of the Universe.}

The constraining power of almost all LSST probes of cosmology (as well as other extragalactic work with LSST) will be greatly strengthened by the addition of spectroscopic redshift measurements for training photometric redshift algorithms.  Obtaining such samples requires spectrographs that maximize multiplexing, areal coverage, wavelength range, resolution, and telescope aperture, as described below.  Studies of cosmology using strong gravitational lensing also requires adaptive optics IFU observations of the highest-priority lens systems in order to obtain precision source precisions and tighten constraints; instruments currently available on 8-10m telescopes or planned for ELTs are well-suited for this work.


%%Almost all LSST probes of cosmology will be greatly strengthened by the addition of spectroscopic redshift measurements for large samples of galaxies.  
%Spectroscopic samples to train photometric redshift algorithms will improve constraints from almost all LSST extragalactic studies, including cosmology.
%%;. spectroscopy obtained with the same instruments can be important for investigating the effects of intrinsic alignments between galaxies on the observed weak lensing signal or for improving the use of galaxy clusters as a cosmological probe, amongst other applications.  
%This work will benefit from spectrographs that maximize multiplexing, areal coverage, wavelength range, resolution, and telescope aperture, as described below.  {\bf By strengthening LSST cosmological constraints and mitigating potential systematics, this spectroscopy will help LSST to address a key objective identified in the {\it New Worlds, New Horizons} report, studying the Physics of the Universe.}
%
%Larger, wider-area samples of bright galaxies and QSOs with redshifts, such as those provided by DESI, can be used to accurately calibrate the results of photometric redshift algorithms via cross-correlation measurements; the same samples can contribute to cross-correlation studies of intrinsic alignments and LSST large-scale structure.  We will focus on the training and calibration of photometric redshift algorithms in this section; however, a broad swath of dark energy science would benefit from the same capabilities, and we highlight a few examples at the end of the section.
