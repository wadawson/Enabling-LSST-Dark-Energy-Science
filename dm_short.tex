\subsection{Science Goals}
Describe your science goals here, as in the scientific justification of an NOAO proposal. If you have multiple science goals, you can either describe them all here, or replicate the science, technical, and capabilities sections for each goal.  Just create one summary table for the entire program.  

\subsection{Technical Description }Give a technical description of your program, describing e.g., sample size and properties, justification of spectral or spatial resolution, wavelength, target density, etc.\subsection{Needed Capabilities and Estimate of Demand}Describe the needed capabilities and demand (e.g., estimate of observing time) that flow down from the science and technical considerations. If applicable, describe the time critical nature of the required capabilities (do you need to have the capabilities while LSST is carrying out the survey or can you do the follow up later?)
